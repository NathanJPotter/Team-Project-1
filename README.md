Examples of hypotheses we could test:

Metropolitan capital cities vs regional areas (rest of the state) over a 7-year period (2012-2019)
Ha1: Mothers in regional areas are likely to have babies at a younger age than mothers in capital cities.
(So, we should find that the mean age of mothers in regional areas is younger than the mean age of mothers in capital cities.)
Ha2: The fertility rate of regionally-based young mothers will be higher than the fertility rate of capital city-based young mothers.
Ha3: The fertility rate of capital city-based older mothers will be higher than the fertility rate of regionally-based older mothers.


Comparing the age of mothers across Australian capital cities over a 7-year period (2012-2019)
Sydney and Melbourne are similar sized cities and the two biggest cities in Australia. So:
Ha4: Mothers in Sydney and Melbourne will have a similar median age.
Ha5: The median age of mothers in Sydney and Melbourne will be older than other capital cities.
Mothers in more remote capital cities will have a younger median age than mothers in other capital cities in Australia. So:
Ha6: The median age of mothers in Darwin and Perth will be younger than mothers in the other capital cities.
Ha7: The median age of mothers in medium-sized, less remote cities (i.e. Adelaide, Brisbane and Hobart) will be in between the median age of mothers in the big capital cities and the more remote capital cities.


Exploring how the median age of young and old mothers, across all Australian capitals and regions, varies over time (i.e. 2012-2019)
We predict an emerging trend where:
Ha7: The median age of mothers will increase over time in all areas across Australia.
Ha8: The fertility rate of young mothers will decrease over time in all areas across Australia.
Ha9: The fertility rate of older mothers will decrease over time in all areas across Australia.
