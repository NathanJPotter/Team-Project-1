**Examples of hypotheses we could test:**
**Ha1**: Australia’s birth rate is decreasing.
**Ha2**: Economic factors are  influencing birth rate

**Observations & fundings**

Initial inspection of the numbers might indicate that the birth rate is erratic and going up and down, possibly even going down. Upon calculation of the regression line, it is clear that this is in fact not the case and that the birth rate is relatively steady, if not increasing slightly. Whilst the trend in the actual number of births is upward, the actual birth rate, relative to 2011 is decreasing.

Looking at the data in more detail, the use of the Y axis limits demonstrates that the swings in rate change are not as violent as one might initially think. If shown on a true scale on the Y axis, the birth rate is again shown to be reasonably stable and flat.

Whilst birth rate is reasonably stable, the population continues to grow, likely due to net migration of people to Australia.

The rate of change in CPI and Wages appear to have no impact on birth rates. CPI and Wages appear to be aligned with wage increases larger than CPI.

Another factor that might impact birth rates, house prices, was considered. I compared metropolitan and rural house prices over time and compared with their relevant birth rates. In this example Sydney and Melbourne are shown with house prices fluctuating but the birth rate (as shown by the size of the circle) to be steady. All states/territories appeared to be the same except for NT, which showed that even as house prices dropped, birth rate was not materially impacted.

**Conclussions**

**Ha1** – The rate of births appears to be in decline, relative to the period for which data has been analysed. Although the actual number of births and population continue in an upward direction.
**Ha2**– There does not appear to be a correlation between economic indicators and birth rate.

Conclusion – More data points are required over a longer period to make a more definitive conclusion that the birth rate is in decline.
